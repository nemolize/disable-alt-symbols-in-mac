# What is this?
This is a layout file that prevents symbols from being entered when you enter letters while holding down the Option key on a Mac.
For example, on my Mac, the symbol `å` is entered with the A + Option keys, but this behavior is prevented.

# How to use
1. download [specialCharsDisabled.bundle.zip](https://github.com/nemolize/disable-alt-symbols-in-mac/blob/master/specialCharsDisabled.bundle.zip?raw=true) and extract.
2. copy `specialCharsDisabled.bundle` to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.
2. open keyboard preferences.
3. click `+` button and choose `English`.
4. choose `specialChartsDisabled` and add.
5. change your input source to `specialChartsDisabled`.
6. Make sure you can not input symbols with `option + letter` keys.  
Note: if no effect, make sure the input source or try rebooting the system to take effect.
